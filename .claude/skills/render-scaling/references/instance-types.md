## Flexible vs non-flexible plans

Some plans are **flexible** (usable in mixed configurations such as **preview environments** alongside other instance types where the platform allows it); others are **non-flexible**. Exact flexible-plan rules depend on workspace and product updates—confirm in the Dashboard or docs when mixing preview and production instance types.

## When to scale up vs out

- **Scale up** (larger **plan**): **Memory-intensive** apps, **single-process** or **single-threaded** architectures, workloads that need **more CPU per request** or **larger heap** without sharding.
- **Scale out** (more **instances**): **Stateless** request handlers, **high concurrency**, **even load distribution** across identical processes.
- **Both**: Start with a **right-sized plan**, then add **horizontal** scaling as traffic grows. Avoid tiny instances multiplied many times if each process needs substantial RAM.

## Free tier limitations

- **Single instance** for the service.
- Web services **spin down after inactivity** (cold starts on the next request).
- **Limited** CPU and memory vs paid plans—treat free-tier behavior as distinct when advising on performance and scaling.
