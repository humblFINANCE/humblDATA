# Refactor Synchronous OpenBB Extraction to Async API Client Pattern

This rule describes how to refactor functions that synchronously extract data from OpenBB (or similar) sources into an asynchronous, API-client-based pattern. Use this rule to standardize data extraction across the codebase.

## When to Apply
# Refactor Synchronous OpenBB Extraction to Async API Client Pattern

This rule describes how to refactor functions that synchronously extract data from OpenBB (or similar) sources into an asynchronous, API-client-based pattern. Use this rule to standardize data extraction across the codebase.

## When to Apply
- The function directly calls `obb.equity.price.historical` or similar synchronous OpenBB SDK methods.
- The function returns or processes a Polars DataFrame (or LazyFrame) from the result.

## How to Refactor
1. **Change the function to `async def` and update all call sites to use `await`.**
2. **Replace direct OpenBB SDK calls with an async API client call:**
   - Instantiate the API client (e.g., `OpenBBAPIClient`).
   - Build query parameters using a Pydantic model (e.g., `EquityHistoricalQueryParams`).
   - Call the API client’s async fetch method (e.g., `await api_client.fetch_data(...)`).
   - Convert the response to a Polars DataFrame or LazyFrame as needed.
3. **Preserve any logic that adds columns or processes the DataFrame after extraction.**
4. **Keep decorators and return values as in the original function.**
5. **Update imports to include the API client and query param model.**
6. **Update or add async-compatible tests.**

## Required Imports
Add or update the following imports as needed:

```python
from humbldata.core.standard_models.openbbapi.EquityHistoricalQueryParams import EquityHistoricalQueryParams
from humbldata.core.utils.openbb_api_client import OpenBBAPIClient
```

Please

## QueryParams File Requirement
- A Pydantic `QueryParams` class **must** exist for the API route being queried (e.g., `EquityHistoricalQueryParams` for `equity.price.historical`).
- This class should be located in the `src/humbldata/core/standard_models/openbbapi/` folder, named according to the route (e.g., `EquityHistoricalQueryParams.py`).
- If the class does not exist, create a new file in that folder with a Pydantic model containing all required parameters for the API route.

## How to Create a QueryParams Class
1. Name the file and class according to the API route (e.g., `EquityHistoricalQueryParams`).
2. Inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel` (or your project's base QueryParams class).
3. Define all required and optional parameters as class attributes, with types and validation as needed.
4. Add docstrings for clarity and maintainability.
5. Place the file in `src/humbldata/core/standard_models/openbbapi/`.

**If you do not know the required parameters for the API route, prompt the user to provide them or to specify the OpenBB endpoint's signature.**

## Example QueryParams Class
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class EquityHistoricalQueryParams(BaseModel):
    symbol: str
    start_date: str
    end_date: str
    provider: str = "yfinance"
    # Add other parameters as needed
```

## Example
**Before:**
```python
self.equity_historical_data: pl.LazyFrame = (
    obb.equity.price.historical(
        symbol=self.context_params.symbols,
        start_date=self.context_params.start_date,
        end_date=self.context_params.end_date,
        provider=self.context_params.provider,
    )
    .to_polars()
    .lazy()
)
```

**After:**
```python
api_query_params = EquityHistoricalQueryParams(
    symbol=self.context_params.symbols,
    start_date=self.context_params.start_date,
    end_date=self.context_params.end_date,
    provider=self.context_params.provider,
)
api_client = OpenBBAPIClient()
api_client.api_query_params = api_query_params
api_response = await api_client.fetch_data(
    obb_path="equity.price.historical",
    api_query_params=api_query_params,
)
self.equity_historical_data = api_response.to_polars(collect=False)
```

## Notes
- Always use the async API client for new or refactored data extraction.
- Use Pydantic models for query params to ensure validation and standardization.
- If the function is part of a class, store the result in an instance variable as before.
- If only one symbol is provided, add the `symbol` column as in the original logic.
- Ensure all downstream code and tests are updated for async compatibility.
