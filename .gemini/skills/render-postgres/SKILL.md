# Render Managed PostgreSQL

This skill covers **Managed Postgres on Render**: how to connect, what cannot change after creation, storage behavior, limits, HA, replicas, and safe deletion. Deep dives live under `references/`.

## When to Use

Apply this skill when the user:

- Configures **Postgres** for an app on Render (URLs, TLS, pooling)
- Creates or changes a **database**, **plan**, **disk**, or **replicas**
- Asks about **backups**, **PITR**, **exports**, or **deleting** a database
- Hits **connection limits**, **SSL errors**, or **latency** between services and DB
- Authors **Blueprint** `databases` / `readReplicas` or wires `fromDatabase`

For deploy flows and Blueprint basics, see **render-deploy** and **render-blueprints**. For private networking between services, see **render-networking**. For env var patterns, see **render-env-vars**.

## Connection Patterns

Render exposes **two connection URLs** for the same logical database:

| URL | Use when | TLS |
|-----|----------|-----|
| **Internal** | App or service on Render in the **same region and workspace** | Not required (private network) |
| **External** | Local development, CI, or tools outside Render | **Required** (TLS 1.2+) |

**Always prefer the internal URL for Render-hosted apps** so traffic stays on Render’s network and avoids extra latency and public egress patterns.

- **IP allow list** applies to **external** access only. Same-region Render services use the **internal** URL regardless of the allow list.
- **External** clients must use TLS; misconfigured clients often show SSL handshake or `sslmode` errors.

URL formats, Dashboard locations, Blueprint `fromDatabase`, pooling, and common mistakes: `references/connection-guide.md`.

## Creation and Setup

- **Instance display name**: Can be changed later (where the Dashboard allows renaming the resource).
- **Immutable after creation**: `databaseName`, database **user**, **region**, **PostgreSQL major version**. Plan these before create; changing them requires a new database and migration.
- **Storage size**: **1 GB** or **multiples of 5 GB** when provisioning.

Wire apps with Blueprint `fromDatabase` using `property: connectionString` (or `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`, `database` individually). See **render-blueprints**.

### Multiple logical databases

You can run `CREATE DATABASE new_db;` in `psql` on the same instance. **Host, port, and credentials stay the same**; only the **database name in the URL path** changes (e.g. `.../myapp` vs `.../new_db`).

## Storage Management

- **Autoscaling**: When disk use reaches roughly **~90%**, Render can grow storage by about **~50%**, rounded up to the **next 5 GB multiple**, up to **16 TB** max.
- **Cannot shrink** disk after an increase.
- **Cooldown**: After a storage increase, you **cannot increase again for 12 hours**.
- **Over limit / unhealthy**: If disk is over the configured limit, the database can become **unhealthy**; Render may **suspend** it until resolved.

Monitor disk and plan exports or cleanup before you hit hard limits. Backup and restore options: `references/backup-and-recovery.md`.

## Connection Limits

Maximum connections depend on **instance RAM** (current-generation plans):

| RAM | Max connections (typical) |
|-----|---------------------------|
| Under 8 GB | 100 |
| 8 GB | 200 |
| 16 GB | 300 |
| 32 GB and above | 500 |

**Legacy** database plans may have **lower** limits; confirm in the Dashboard or API for the specific plan.

Render does **not** provide a built-in pooler; use **application-side pooling** (framework pools, PgBouncer, pgpool, etc.). Limits are **hard**—exhausting them causes connection errors. More detail: `references/connection-guide.md` and `references/performance-tuning.md`.

## High Availability

**High availability (HA)** is available when:

- Workspace is **Professional** or higher, **and**
- Database plan is **Pro** or higher, **and**
- **PostgreSQL 13+**

**Instance type changes** cause **brief downtime**. With HA, downtime is typically **less** than **without HA** (often on the order of **minutes** without HA—exact duration depends on plan and operation).

**One-way migration off legacy types**: After moving to current-generation instance types, you **cannot** move back to **legacy** instance types.

## Read Replicas

- Up to **5 read replicas** per database.
- In Blueprints, declare replicas under **`readReplicas`** as a **list of names**.
- **CAUTION — declarative sync**:
  - An **empty** `readReplicas` list can **destroy all** existing replicas.
  - **Name mismatches** between the Blueprint and live replicas can **create** new replicas and **remove** replicas whose names are no longer listed.

Always treat `readReplicas` as **authoritative** desired state, not additive-only.

## Useful MCP Commands

Use the Render MCP tools (names may vary slightly by integration; align with your server’s tool list):

| Goal | Tool / pattern |
|------|----------------|
| List databases | `list_postgres_instances` |
| Instance details | `get_postgres` with `postgresId` |
| Read-only SQL | `query_render_postgres` with `postgresId` and `sql` |
| Connection load | `get_metrics` with `resourceId` (Postgres ID) and `metricTypes: ["active_connections"]` |

`query_render_postgres` runs in a **read-only** transaction and opens a **new connection per query**—do not use it as a substitute for app pooling.

Shorthand (same tools): `list_postgres_instances()`, `get_postgres(postgresId)`, `query_render_postgres(postgresId, sql)`, `get_metrics(resourceId, metricTypes: ["active_connections"])`.

## Deleting and Data Safety

- **Backups and snapshots are not retained** after you **delete** the database. **Export first** (`pg_dump`, Dashboard restore workflow from existing backups, etc.).
- Before destructive actions, confirm retention and recovery paths in `references/backup-and-recovery.md`.
