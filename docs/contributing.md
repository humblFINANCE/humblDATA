# 📝 __Contributing Guidelines__

## 🎯 __Expectations for Contributors__

Here is a set of guidelines that you should follow:

1. Use Cases:
    - Ensure that your contributions directly enhance the humbldata's functionality or extension ecosystem.

2. Documentation:
    - All code contributions should come with relevant documentation, including the purpose of the contribution, how it works, and any changes it makes to existing functionalities.
    - Update any existing documentation if your contribution alters the behavior of the humbldata.

3. Code Quality:
    - Your code should adhere strictly to the humbldata's coding standards and conventions.
    - Ensure clarity, maintainability, and proper organization in your code.

4. Testing:
    - All contributions must be thoroughly tested to avoid introducing bugs to the humbldata.
    - Contributions should include relevant automated tests (unit and integration), and any new feature should come with its test cases.

5. Performance:
    - Your contributions should be optimized for performance and should not degrade the overall efficiency of the humbldata.
    - Address any potential bottlenecks and ensure scalability.

6. Collaboration:
    - Engage actively with the humbldata development team to ensure that your contributions align with the platform's roadmap and standards.
    - Welcome feedback and be open to making revisions based on reviews and suggestions from the community.

## 🏆 __Best Practices__

- Review Platform Dependencies: Before adding any dependency, ensure it aligns with the Platform's existing dependencies.
- Use Loose Versioning: If possible, specify a range to maintain compatibility. E.g., `>=1.4,<1.5`.
- Testing: Test your extension with the Platform's core to avoid conflicts. Both unit and integration tests are recommended.
- Document Dependencies: Use `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` for clear, up-to-date records

## 🐍 __Code Standards__
### 🪺PEP Guidelines
You must adhere to the strict guidelines of coding best practices. Here is a non-exhaustive list of the most important guidelines to follow:

1. **PEP 8**: This is the de-facto code style guide for Python. It is a set of conventions for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability.
    - It is a set of conventions for how to format your Python code to maximize its readability.
2. **PEP 484**: This PEP introduces a standard for type annotations in Python. It aims to provide a standard syntax for type annotations, opening up Python code to easier static analysis and refactoring.

??? abstract "The Zen of Python"
      Beautiful is better than ugly.

      Explicit is better than implicit.

      Simple is better than complex.

      Complex is better than complicated.

      Flat is better than nested.

      Sparse is better than dense.

      Readability counts.

      Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

      Although practicality beats purity.

      Errors should never pass silently.

      Unless explicitly silenced.

      In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

      There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

      Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

      Now is better than never.

      Although never is often better than *right* now.

      If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

      If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

      Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## ➕ Adding a Function

If you want to add a function, first you must decide. What is the context, category and command? Once, you have done that you will need to do these 3 things:

1. ### **Define `QueryParams` and `Data` Standard Model.**

    Put your new standard model in:

     ```
     humbldata.core.standard_models.<context>.<category>.<your_func>
     ```

    This should be a `.py` file.
    ```
    ~\humbldata\src\humbldata\core\standard_models\<context>\<category>\<command>.py
    ```

    You will then define two classes: `QueryParams` and `Data`. The fields used to query the data and then the returned data fields, respectively.

    ```py
    """
    <Your Function> Standard Model.

    Context: Toolbox || Category: Technical || Command: <Your Function>.

    This module is used to define the QueryParams and Data model for the
    <Your Function> command.
    """
    from humbldata.core.standard_models.abstract.data import Data
    from humbldata.core.standard_models.abstract.query_params import QueryParams
    class <YourFunc>QueryParams(QueryParams):
        """
        QueryParam for the <Your Function> command.
        """
    class <YourFunc>Data(Data):
        """
        Data model for the <Your Function> command.
        """
    ```
2. ### **Add the Function Logic (model.py) to the `Context` module**

    Each `<command>` has a `model.py`, `view.py` and `helper.py` file.

    Add these files to the `Context` module.
    ```py
    humbldata/
    ├── <context>/
    │   ├── <category>/
    │   │   ├── <your_func>/
    │   │   │   ├── model.py
    │   │   │   ├── view.py
    │   │   │   └── helper.py

    humbldata.<context>.<category>.<your_func>.model/view/helper.py

    # i.e

    humbldata/
    ├── toolbox/
    │   ├── technical/
    │   │   ├── mandelbrot_channel/
    │   │   │   ├── model.py
    │   │   │   ├── view.py
    │   │   │   └── helper.py

    humbldata.toolbox.technical.mandelbrot_channel.model
    ```

     !!! tip It is common practice in the repo to prepend your logic function with `calc_...`.
     So the function would be `calc_mandelbrot_channel`.


## 🧪 Adding a Test

### Test Requirements
It is required to add tests to cover all the code that you add to the package. Here are the
guidelines to help you organize the tests you need to add.

#### Overview
Tests are categorized into two main types:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - These test individual units of functionality.
   - They should be independent from other tests and external dependencies.
2. **Integration Tests**:
   - These test the combination of units working together.
   - They verify full functionality and interaction between components.

#### Test Organization
The tests should be organized according to the CCCC framework: Core, Context, Category, Command. The directory structure for tests should reflect this organization.

#### Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── integration/
│   ├── context/
│   │   ├── category/
│   │   │   ├── command/
│   │   │   │   └── test_queryParams_data_fetcher.py
│   │   │   │   └── test_view.py
│   │   │   │   └── test_model.py
│   │   ├── test_methods.py
│   └── test_queryParams.py
└── unittests/
    ├── context/
    │   ├── category/
    │   │   ├── command/
    │   │   │   └── test_helpers.py
    │   │   │   └── test_view.py
    │   │   │   └── test_model.py
    │   │   ├── test_methods.py
    ├── test_helpers.py
```

### Expectations for Test Creation
- **Independence**: Ensure unit tests do not rely on external systems or other tests.
- **Comprehensiveness**: Write tests to cover all possible edge cases.
- **Clarity**: Name tests clearly to indicate what functionality they cover.
- **Consistency**: Follow the CCCC framework for organizing tests.
- **Documentation**: Document any non-trivial logic within the tests for future reference.
